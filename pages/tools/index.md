Welcome to the Call of Duty: Black Ops III Section of my Wiki. Here you can find plenty of tutorials for mapping, scripting, and more!

You can use the side bar to naviage to different tutorials, each type of tutorial is split into mapping, scripting, downloads, etc:

* **Tools/Plugins**: These are tutorials and downloads for tools I've made that are specific to Black Ops III but do not require their own pages in the Tools section.
* **Mapping**: These are tutorials that relate to Radiant such as prefabs, tutorials, etc.
* **Features**: These are tutorials that can be added as small features to your Map/Mod.
* **Scripting**: These are tutorials that relate scripting such as creating perks, how to do xyz, etc. This section covers Lua and GSC/CSC.
* **Misc.**: These are tutorials that can apply to anything and do not fit the other sections.
* **Downloads** These are packages you can download to include in your Map/Mod, including Perks, Characters, Ports, etc.

If you would like to make a suggestion or report issues you can do so on the repository by [Clicking Here](https://github.com/Scobalula/wiki), or you can leave a comment on the tutorial's page.
